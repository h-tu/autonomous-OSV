### Disclaimer: 
This project is inspired by UMD ENES100 course and was build off of the base that was done on both software and hardware side by the ENES100 faculties. For more information you are welcomed to visit their website. I do no own any of the ENES100 library.

You can find all the information that you will need about ENES100 library here: [documentation](https://github.com/h-tu/autonomous-OSV/blob/master/Using%20the%20Arduino%20Library.pdf)

This library is required for the code in this project to function properly.

### Main objective
* Navigate to within 250 mm of the aircraft debris (mission site)
* Measure and transmit the type of material present
* Transmitted material type is correct

### Advanced Requirements:
* Acquire the debris by lifting it entirely off of the sand
* Determine the mass of the debris to within 20 g and transmit the result
